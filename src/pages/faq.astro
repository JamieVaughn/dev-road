      <strong>What do I need to succeed in this course?</strong>
      <p>
        We'll be writing web software together, so you will need a computer and
        a positive, curious educational mindset! You'll also want to setup your
        computer by downloading & installing various software, especially the <a
          href="https://code.visualstudio.com/">VS Code editor</a
        >. The other setup software you can find in the website footer under
        "Getting Started," and we'll go through the setup process together for
        these as needed.

      <strong>How do I do the homework?</strong>
      <p>
        Just complete the FCC exercises and submit your solutions on that site.

      <strong>How do I see the slides from lecture?</strong>

        <strong>How is my grade determined?</strong>
        <p>
          This course is graded in terms of Pass/Fail. The factors that
          contribute to a passing determination in rough order of consideration
          are:

          >What should I do if I will have a conflict with one of our classes?</strong
        >
        <p>
          That's alright, conflicts happen. Please just let me know ahead of
          time by sending me an email or messaging me in discord about which
          class you must miss. In most cases, you will be expected to review the
          slides/content that you missed on your own so that you can still
          complete the associated project and/or homework.
